In real production you should try to separate the UI and API.
Why?
Simple, low risk, UI only deploys
Separate Concerns
	Separate teams
	Less to understand
	Scale back-end separately
Cheap UI hosting
Serve UI via a content delivery network (CDN)
Use the API tech you like

Automated Deployment:
Github pages, Surge host static files only on cloud.
AWS, Azure, Heroku, Firebase, Google cloud platform are other cloud hosting options.

For API we will use Heroku and for UI we will use Surge.

Let's setup automated deployment on API to Heroku.

we will use a new project for this.

use commands:
heroku login
heroku create
heroku git:remote -a <heroku app name>
git push heroku master

Now api is hosted on Heroku.

Use the URL and upade Base URL file and distserver - remove json section.

Let's use surge to deploy UI section.

In package json add following script:
"deploy": "surge ./dist"

npm run deploy
