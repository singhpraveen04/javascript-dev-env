Not too long ago bower package manager was the most popular one.\
But now a days developers have shifted to npm package manager.

Bower became popular by supporting entire web platform and packaging libraries in a format that didn't requrie build step but now a days everyone has a build step.

Bower is actually package manager for front end related files. (Another course)


JSPM(Java Script Package Manager) is also another option.It can download packages from its repository as well as npm or bower's repository. It also bundles the code.

We will go ahead with npm.

Install node and npm

copy package json from here:
bit.ly/jsdevpackagejson


use command npm install to download dependencies

- To check package dependencies for known vunerabilities:
1) Retire.js
2) Node Security Platform

in Node Security Platform use the following command to check for security:
nsp check

we can run node security platform by 
1) Manually
2) Include it in start script

Options:
Manually - Easy to forget
npm install - May be issue later
production build - expensive to change
pull request - expensive to change
npm start  - slows start slightly

To setup node security platform:
npm install -g nsp

as we are going to execute the process manually, enter the command :
nsp check
